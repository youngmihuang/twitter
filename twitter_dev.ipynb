    "The Twitter live public stream is a sample (approximately 1%) of all Tweets that are currently being published by users. They can be on any topic and in any language. In your request, you can give keywords which will narrow down the Tweets that get delivered to you. Our first example looks for Tweets which include either the word *love* or *hate*. We limit the call to finding 10 tweets. When you run this code, it will definitely produce different results from those shown below!"
